Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a number of incredible projects that have allowed me to grow and develop my skills and passions. Go ahead and explore; I hope you’ll enjoy viewing my projects as much as I enjoyed working on them.

## Biomedical Engineering

### Transcranial Doppler Headset Design for Real-time Continuous Brain Monitoring
#### Mar 2021 – Apr 2021

- Drafted configuration of a transcranial Doppler headset with bilateral transducers, adjustable headbands, and Bluetooth connectivity to combat current probe issues of time limits, instability, and inconvenience
- Constructed the headset, using OnShape, meant to support an athlete post-mild traumatic brain injury w/ relevant documentation including sketches of assemblies, descriptions of material properties, and discussion of design strengths and weaknesses
- Designed a mobile application interface for a digital health platform using Figma such that it visualizes and centralizes all images, charts and metrics and allows for a concise overview of insights, trends, and patterns to be shared with the physician
- Cooperated in a group of four to identify ethical and legal considerations, research various testing standards, and discuss regulatory constraints applicable to our design

### Design of a Segway as a Power-Driven Mobility Device
#### Feb 2021 – Mar 2021

- Designed and constructed a Segway, using OnShape, meant to support the average adult with a mobility impairment
- Prepared documentation detailing lists of parts, sketches of assemblies, descriptions of material properties, and discussion of design strengths and weaknesses

### Ergonomic Probe Design for Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia
#### Feb 2021 – Mar 2021

- Drafted configuration of an ultrasound probe with rotatable wire, more machine connectivity, and better grip design to ease anesthesiologist pain during operations
- Cooperated in a group of five to brainstorm possible solutions, create and compromise on a Pugh Chart, and research various testing standards
applicable to our design
- Discussed the architecture of current ultrasound machines with an anesthesiologist and communicated how enhanced functionality can ease physician fatigue

### Antibiotic-Releasing Nanoparticles for Inguinal Hernia Repair
#### Jan 2021 – Feb 2021

- Designed novel surgical mesh implanted with nanoparticle drug delivery system to ease chronic pain post-inguinal hernia surgery
- Collaborated in a team of four to assess functional requirements, analyze potential stakeholders, and justify proposed solution
- Communicated with a gastrointestinal surgeon to create problem definition and discuss concept generation

## Computer Science

### Image Processing for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
#### Aug 2020 – Dec 2020

- Automatic detection of diabetic retinopathy exudates from retinal images using mathematical morphology methods.
- Constructed and executed six-stage pipeline involving batch file processing, green channel extraction, CLAHE contrast adjustment, foreground image analysis, binarized segmentation, and pixelated classification.
- Won Best Spotlight Presentation Award out of 10 total teams

### AI Chat Bot for COVID-19 Diagnosis
#### Aug 2020 – Sep 2020

- AI chatbox application using both linear and non-linear dialogue to iterate through a series of intents and actions.
- Compiles inputs to assess COVID-19 related needs and direct users to resources that best fit their conditions.
- Built with Google Dialogflow and integrated with Kommunicate.io to enhance usability and functionality.
- Embedded into a React App, connected to Google Cloud, and published through Heroku
