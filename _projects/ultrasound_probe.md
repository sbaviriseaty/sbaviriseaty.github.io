#### Feb 2021 â€“ Mar 2021

- Drafted configuration of an ultrasound probe with rotatable wire, more machine connectivity, and better grip design to ease anesthesiologist pain during operations
- Cooperated in a group of five to brainstorm possible solutions, create and compromise on a Pugh Chart, and research various testing standards
applicable to our design
- Discussed the architecture of current ultrasound machines with an anesthesiologist and communicated how enhanced functionality can ease physician fatigue
