#### Mar 2021 â€“ Apr 2021

- Drafted configuration of a transcranial Doppler headset with bilateral transducers, adjustable headbands, and Bluetooth connectivity to combat current probe issues of time limits, instability, and inconvenience
- Constructed the headset, using OnShape, meant to support an athlete post-mild traumatic brain injury w/ relevant documentation including sketches of assemblies, descriptions of material properties, and discussion of design strengths and weaknesses
- Designed a mobile application interface for a digital health platform using Figma such that it visualizes and centralizes all images, charts and metrics and allows for a concise overview of insights, trends, and patterns to be shared with the physician
- Cooperated in a group of four to identify ethical and legal considerations, research various testing standards, and discuss regulatory constraints applicable to our design
