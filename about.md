I am a rising senior studying biomedical engineering at the University of Florida. I hope to go to graduate school to pursue more research focusing on the intersection between healthcare and machine learning. I would like to take coursework on the ethical dimensions of intertwining the two and the basis of socially-aware algorithm design. Ultimately, I plan to move into an industry position with a focus on diabetes technology.
