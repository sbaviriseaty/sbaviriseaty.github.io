Hi, I'm Sruthika, a rising senior at UF, from Tampa, FL. 

From experimental passion projects to rigorous academic pursuits, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to create a variety of experiences during my undergraduate career. I thrive on creative challenges and enjoy building strong relationships along the way. 

TO-DO
- [Add favicon](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman/issues/93)

- [Modify navigation](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/navigation)

Interested in learning more about me, my work, or how we can collaborate on an upcoming project? Feel free to reach out anytime at [sbaviriseaty dot gmail dot com](mailto:sbaviriseaty@gmail.com). I would also be more than happy to connect on [Twitter](twitter.com/sbaviriseaty) or [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/sbaviriseaty). 

The code for this website, as well as many other labors of love, can be found on my [GitHub](github.com/sbaviriseaty).
